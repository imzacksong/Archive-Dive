**Doomscroll the Past.**

Archive Dive is a unique video streaming experience that brings the vast, eccentric, and historical collection of the **Internet Archive** to your mobile device in a modern, vertical video feed. Think of it as "TikTok for the 20th Century."

Discover lost films, vintage commercials, educational reels, silent movies, and bizarre ephemeral footage tailored to your interests.

## 📺 The Experience

-   **"Variety Sort" Engine**: Our custom randomization logic allows you to pick your favorite genres (Sci-Fi, Horror, Animation, etc.) and ensures a diverse mix of content, so you never get stuck watching the same type of clip twice in a row.
-   **No Account Needed**: Just launch, pick your tags, and start diving.
